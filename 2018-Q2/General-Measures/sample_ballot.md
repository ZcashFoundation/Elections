Proposed ballot entry:

```
The Foundation should endeavor to establish the official Zcash mascot as one of the following choices:

```

## Point-Counterpoint on Each Choice

### Zeal

Pro: Many mascots are better than one, and it's a collection of Zebras. Speaks to strength in numbers.

Con: Some people don't like zebras. Logistically more difficult than single mascot

### Waterbear
